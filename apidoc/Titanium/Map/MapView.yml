name: Titanium.Map.MapView
summary: Map view is used for embedding native mapping capabilities as a view in your application.  
description: |
    With native maps, you can control the mapping location, the type of map, the zoom level 
    and you can add custom annotations directly to the map. Use the <Titanium.Map.createView>
    method to create a map view.

    For Android, you will need to 
    <a href="http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html">obtain a map key from Google</a> 
    to use maps in your application. 
    
    On iPhone, you cannot call any methods on a map view until it has been added to a view.
