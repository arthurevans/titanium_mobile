summary: A Popover is used to manage the presentation of content in a popover. 
description: |
    You use popovers to present information temporarily but in a way that does not take over 
    the entire screen like a modal view does. The popover content is layered on top of your 
    existing content in a special type of window. The popover remains visible until the user 
    taps outside of the popover window or you explicitly dismiss it. The Popover is created 
    by the method <Titanium.UI.iPad.createPopover>.
