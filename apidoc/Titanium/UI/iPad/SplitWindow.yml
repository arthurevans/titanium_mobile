name: Titanium.UI.iPad.SplitWindow
summary: |
    A SplitWindow is a window that manages the presentation of two side-by-side view 
    controllers. You use this class to implement a master-detail interface, in which the 
    left-side view presents a list of items and the right-side presents details of the 
    selected item. The SplitView is for use exclusively on iPad devices. The SplitWindow 
    is created by the method <Titanium.UI.iPad.createSplitWindow>.
    
    The SplitWindow inherits its methods and properties from <Titanium.UI.Window>.
    
    The `masterView` and `detailView` properties are required in the constructor of the 
    SplitWindow and cannot be changed once set.
    
    The SplitWindow is a top-level window and cannot be contained within another window or view.
