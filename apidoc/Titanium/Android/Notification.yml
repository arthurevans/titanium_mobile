description: |
    If you pass contentTitle and/or contentText into <Titanium.Android.createNotification>, 
    then setLatestEventInfo will automatically be called with those properties (there's no need 
    to call it separately unless you want to). You can also use a custom layout.xml wrapped in 
    a <Titanium.Android.RemoteViews> object in the contentView property, which gives more 
    fine grained control and customization to how the notification actually behaves.
