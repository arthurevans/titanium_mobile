name: Titanium.Buffer
summary: Buffer is a container for raw data. A buffer is created by the method `Titanium.createBuffer`.
extends: Titanium.Proxy
since: "1.7"
platforms: [android, iphone, ipad]

properties:
  - name: length
    type: Number
    summary: The length of the buffer in bytes. When `length` is modified the buffer will be re-sized while preserving existing data where possible. If the new buffer length is smaller than the length of the existing data then the existing data will be truncated down to the size of the new buffer.  Resizing the buffer via setting length should be used sparingly due to the associated overhead.
    default: 0, unless `value` is specified, at which case the length of the encoded data is used
  - name: value
    type: [Number, String]
    availability: creation
    summary: Data to be encoded. If `value` is a Number, `type` must also be set. (this is simply a convenient way of calling <Titanium.Codec.encodeString> or <Titanium.Codec.encodeNumber>).
  - name:  type
    type: String
    availability: creation
    summary: The type of data encoding to use with `value`. Required when `value` is a Number. When `value` is a String, <Titanium.Codec.CHARSET_UTF8> is the default.
  - name: byteOrder
    type: Number
    availability: creation
    summary: The byte order of this buffer. The OS native byte order is used by default.

methods:
  - name: append
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes appended.
    summary: appends `sourceBuffer` to the current buffer.  Buffer is grown dynamically to accommodate the additional data if need be.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        summary: buffer to append to current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
  - name: append
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes appended.
    summary: same as normal append except this allows appending only `sourceLength` bytes from the `sourceBuffer` starting at `sourceOffset`.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        summary: buffer to append to current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
      - name: sourceOffset
        summary: offset to start reading buffer data from
        type: Number
      - name: sourceLength
        summary: length of data to read from buffer
        type: Number
  - name: insert
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes inserted.
    summary: inserts `sourceBuffer` into the current buffer at `offset`.  Buffer is grown to accommodate the new data.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        summary: buffer to insert into current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
      - name: offset
        summary: offset to insert new buffer at
        type: Number
  - name: insert
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes inserted.
    summary: inserts `sourceLength` amount of data starting at `sourceOffset` from `sourceBuffer` into current buffer at `offset`.  Buffer is grown to accommodate the new data.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        summary: buffer to insert into current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
      - name: offset
        summary: offset to insert new buffer at
        type: Number
      - name: sourceOffset
        summary: offset of sourceBuffer to insert data from
        type: Number
      - name: sourceLength
        summary: length of data from sourceBuffer to insert
        type: Number
  - name: copy
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes copied.
    summary: copies the contents of `sourceBuffer` into the current buffer at `offset`.  will not expand buffer if there is not enough room in the current buffer to accomodate all the requested data from `sourceBuffer`.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        summary: buffer to copy into current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
      - name: offset
        summary: offset to copy new buffer at
        type: Number
  - name: copy
    returns:
        type: Number
        summary: The number of bytes copied.
    summary: copies `sourceLength` contents from `sourceBuffer` starting at `sourceOffset` into the current buffer at `offset`.  will not expand buffer if there is not enough room in the current buffer to accomodate all the request data from `sourceBuffer`.
    parameters:
      - name: sourceBuffer
        summary: buffer to copy into current buffer
        type: Titanium.Buffer
      - name: offset
        summary: offset to copy new buffer at
        type: Number
      - name: sourceOffset
        summary: offset of sourceBuffer to copy data from
        type: Number
      - name: sourceLength
        summary: length of data from sourceBuffer to copy
        type: Number
  - name: clone
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Buffer
    summary: create new copy of the current buffer
  - name: clone
    returns:
        type: Titanium.Buffer
    summary: Creates a new buffer from the original buffer contents starting at `offset` and ending at `offset` + `length`
    parameters:
      - name: offset
        summary: offset of buffer to start clone
        type: Number
      - name: length
        summary: length of buffer data starting at offset to clone
        type: Number
  - name: fill
    summary: fills buffer with `fillByte`
    parameters:
      - name: fillByte
        summary: byte to fill buffer with
        type: Number
  - name: fill
    summary: fills buffer starting from `offset` until `length` number of `fillByte` has been written or the end of the buffer is reached
    parameters:
      - name: fillByte
        summary: byte to fill buffer with
        type: Number
